make sendFile(), receiveFile() stuff silent, and return sufficient info
    so that callers can decide what to do.

x have pc-side debugging use the same sendFile() and receiveFile() as codea

send/receive other types of files?

project dependency files?

force linefeed on last lines of files

x store settings in local/project storage.

x on sendFile, have server get crc and decide if it needs the file.

x do git rebase to combine all interactions (or not.)

x receive causes needless updates of crc history files.

x rename

add copyright notices

README/documentation

x clean up debug printf's on receive side.

automatically adjust if git isn't available (no .git)
    (but on a per-directory late-bound basis..) (or not?  warning??)

x make one client-side program with Send/Receive choice.

x move "doit" button to the end so it is visible after editing project choice.

x 'save' button for settings

unencumbered crc implementation?

x if a send from client to server would wipe out server-side version with
    uncommitted changes, refuse to do it.  or, just automatically commit it.
